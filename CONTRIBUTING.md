# [Flannel][readme-md] - Contributing

Very few guidelines:

- Doc your code
- Make a README.md if it's complex
- Don't monkey-patch parts of flannel please
- Follow [semantic versions][semantic-versioning-doc]
- Scope `internal` functions with `_flannel_modulename_`
- Use close to pure BASH please.
