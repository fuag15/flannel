# Bash Functions / Utilities

This is a repo of things for me to source @ work, @ home, @ play

## Manifesto

- If you do it twice, automate it
- Nice code is nice, automation is nicer, make pretty a secondary concern, improve over time

## Current Modules

- hg_mass: scripts for dealing with lots of pulls / pushes at once
- git_quick: often tasks in git automated
- swap: swap out configs and id's
- aliases: quick and dirty list of aliases

## Caveats

- No warnings or error checking
- has to be in ~/bashrc to work
