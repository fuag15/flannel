# [Flannel][readme-md] - Road Map

- add `FLANNEL_PELLETS` as global state to help `lint_pellets` track reverse dependency fixes. Provide a strong and weak method, weak clears broken dependencies, strong fixes. takes a glob for module to search for, pellets include parameters passed
- set set up versions
- Make clear a convention
- Add README.md to complex modules
- Organize for distribution *( most likely lib, dist, contrib model )*
- Set up central distribution / version file
- Make `thrift` the sharing / distribution module
- curl baste one liner
- Stabilize
- make verbose
- add hooks to `flannel`? possibly bad idea, list of functions to run before, after load and before, after glob
- Enjoy
