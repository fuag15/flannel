# [Flannel][readme-md] - Road Map

- make test convention (module/test) (shunit2 module)
- bounded requirement and pellet logic
- tidy up code / functions
- add hooks to `flannel`? possibly bad idea, list of functions to run before, after load and before, after glob
- move flannel int fuzzy_plaid? just source init.
- set up packaging
- Organize for distribution, make loading precidence to allow for overriding of default modules without modifying source *( most likely lib, dist, contrib model )*
- Set up central distribution / version file and module version files
- Make `thrift` the sharing / distribution module, pulls from here
- curl based one liner
- auto update your bashrc for progams that will launch
- Stabilize
- set set up versioning
- make verbose
- beautify with an image / icon for this repo
- Enjoy
