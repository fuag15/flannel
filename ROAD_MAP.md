# [Flannel][readme-md] - Road Map

- add `requirements` the version logic module and use it in vfx
- set set up versions
- Make `clear` a convention
- Organize for distribution, make loading precidence to allow for overriding of default modules without modifying source *( most likely lib, dist, contrib model )*
- Set up central distribution / version file and module version files
- Make `thrift` the sharing / distribution module, pulls from here
- curl based one liner
- Stabilize
- make verbose
- add hooks to `flannel`? possibly bad idea, list of functions to run before, after load and before, after glob
- beautify with an image / icon for this repo
- Enjoy
